            <p>Lorraine. Okay. Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. She's just trying to keep you respectable. Doc, she didn't even look at him.</p>
            <p>C'mon. Holy shit. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared.</p>
            <p>This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father. I think I know exactly what you mean. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? No, Biff, you leave her alone. Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you.</p>
            <p>Well, they're bigger than me. Leave her alone, you bastard. Take care. Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. Now which one was it, Greg or Craig?</p>

            <img src="./images/time travel experiment.jpg" alt="Time Travel Experiment Image">
            <p>Time Travel Experiment</p>
            <p> - The goal of this project is to design and build a machine that can travel through time. Students will need to research and experiment with different theories and technologies, as well as consider the ethical implications of time travel.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="work">
            <img src="./images/interdimentional portal.jpg" alt="Interdimensional Portal Image">
            <p>Interdimensional Portal</p>
            <p> - The objective of this project is to design and create a portal that can transport people to different dimensions. Students will need to understand the concept of parallel universes, and find ways to make travel between them possible.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="work">
            <img src="./images/mind-reading machine.jpg" alt="Mind-Reading Machine Image">
            <p>Mind-Reading Machine</p>
            <p> - This project aims to develop a device that can read people's thoughts. Students will need to explore the science of the brain, and experiment with different technologies to try to achieve mind-reading capabilities.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="work">
            <img src="./images/invisibility cloak.jpg" alt="Invisibility Cloak Image">
            <p>Invisibility Cloak</p>
            <p> - The challenge in this project is to design and create a cloak that can make the wearer invisible. Students will need to understand the principles of light and optics, and experiment with materials and technologies that can bend or redirect light.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="work">
            <img src="./images/teleportation device.png" alt="Teleportation Device Image">
            <p>Teleportation Device</p>
            <p> - The goal of this project is to build a machine that can instantly transport people from one place to another. Students will need to understand the laws of physics, and come up with ways to overcome the obstacles to teleportation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="work">
            <img src="./images/anti-gravity engine.jpg" alt="Anti-Gravity Engine Image">
            <p>Anti-Gravity Engine</p>
            <p> - The objective of this project is to develop a machine that can generate an anti-gravity field, allowing objects to float and defy the laws of physics. Students will need to understand the principles of gravity, and experiment with different technologies to achieve anti-gravity effects.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="work">
            <img src="./images/artificial intelligence companion.jpg" alt="Artificial Intelligence Companion Image">
            <p>Artificial Intelligence Companion</p>
            <p> - This project aims to create an artificial intelligence that can interact with humans, and serve as a companion. Students will need to understand the principles of AI and machine learning, and experiment with different technologies to build an AI system that can learn, respond, and adapt.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="work">
            <img src="./images/mind-controlled robot.jpg" alt="Mind-Controlled Robot Image">
            <p>Mind-Controlled Robot</p>
            <p> - The challenge in this project is to design and build a robot that can be controlled by the user's thoughts. Students will need to explore the science of the brain, and experiment with different technologies to achieve mind-controlled robots.</p>
